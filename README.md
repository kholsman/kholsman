## About me

I am a Research Fishery Biologist with the Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling team at NOAAâ€™s Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. My research focuses on developing quantitative methods to support climate-ready Ecosystem-Based Management for the North Pacific and Arctic marine ecosystems. I work in multidisciplinary collaborations to provide information, advice, and tools that help resource managers and decision-makers effectively respond to climate change and associated shocks.

I am a co-lead investigator of the Alaska Climate Integrated Modeling Project, co-chair of the North Pacific Marine Fisheries Council Climate Change Task Force, and serve as a regional and national representative for the NOAA Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program and the NOAA Climate Ecosystem and Fisheries Initiative. I also contribute to several national and international climate change strategic initiatives and have co-authored regional, national, and international climate change assessments, including the IPCC WGII 6th Assessment Report and the 5th U.S. National Climate Assessment.
